# TASK 2: Calculating Pi using Leibniz formula and multithreading
The Leibniz formula is an infinite series method of calculating Pi. The formula is a very simple way of
calculating Pi, however, it takes a large amount of iterations to produce a low precision value of Pi.
This task requires a large amount of computation and therefore it is vital that you use multithreading
to speed up the program. Below is the Leibniz formula:

As the series can be iterated infinite number of times, your program should allow the user to take in
2 inputs; the first is the number of iterations and the second is the number of threads the user would
like to use. This means that the slicing of workload needs to be dynamic.
